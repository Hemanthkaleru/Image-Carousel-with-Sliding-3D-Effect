# Image-Carousel-with-Sliding-3D-Effect
This project showcases an interactive image carousel with a 3D sliding effect. The images in the carousel have smooth transitions with a perspective effect, creating an engaging visual experience. Each image slides forward and highlights on hover or focus, while the surrounding images rotate slightly to emphasize depth.

Features:
3D Sliding Effect: When you hover over or focus on an image, it smoothly enlarges and moves forward, giving a 3D perspective.
Interactive Carousel: Users can navigate through images using hover or keyboard navigation (with tabindex for accessibility).
CSS Transitions: The effect is achieved using CSS transitions and transforms to create a seamless sliding experience.
Customizable: Easily change the images by updating the background image paths.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Replace the images in the /Media folder with your own.
Customize the CSS file to adjust effects as needed.
Open the index.html file in your browser to view the effect.
This project is ideal for learning CSS transformations and building visually appealing web components.
